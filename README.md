# Clinic Management System API 🏥

A RESTful Web API for managing doctors, patients, clinics, appointments, and diagnoses — built with ASP.NET Core Web API using a clean, layered, and scalable architecture.

---

## ✅ What's Done

- ✅ Structured using layered architecture: **Controllers ➜ Services ➜ Repositories ➜ Unit of Work**
- ✅ Applied **Entity Framework Core** (Code First) with **Fluent API**
- ✅ Built full **CRUD operations** for:
  - 🧑‍⚕️ Doctor
  - 👤 Patient
  - 🏥 Clinic
  - 📅 Appointment
  - 📝 Diagnosis
- ✅ Used **AutoMapper** for clean and efficient DTO mapping
- ✅ Implemented full **async/await** pattern to avoid blocking calls
- ✅ Added **custom `ApiResponse<T>` wrapper** to unify all API responses
- ✅ Implemented **global model validation filter**
- ✅ Added **global exception handling middleware** for consistent error responses
- ✅ Committed to **Clean Code**, **SOLID principles**, and separation of concerns
- ✅ Implemented **Basic Jwt token generator**

## 📦 Project Features

- ✅ Clean, unified API response format for all endpoints
- ✅ Centralized model validation using filters
- ✅ Global exception handling using middleware
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (Layered Architecture)
- ✅ Entity-DTO mapping using AutoMapper
- ✅ Repositories isolated from services using interfaces
- ✅ Consistent status codes and error handling

---

## 🧠 Architecture

- `Controllers` → Handle API endpoints (request/response)
- `Services` → Business logic + cross-cutting concerns
- `Repositories` → Direct database communication
- `Unit of Work` → Manage transactions and consistency
- `DTOs` → Abstract and sanitize data across layers
- `AutoMapper` → Clean transformation between Entities ⇄ DTOs
- `Filters` → Centralize model validation logic
- `Middleware` → Catch and format global exceptions

---

## 🔐 Security

JWT authentication is currently being integrated to secure endpoints and support user roles (e.g., Admin, Doctor).

---

## 🚀 Project Status

The **core backend features are complete**, covering all major clinic operations.  
The API now returns **consistent structured responses**, and follows best practices in clean architecture, async programming, and RESTful API design.

---

## 📌 Notes

This project is being built from scratch to master backend development using .NET — applying layered design, clean practices, and production-level coding standards — with the goal of becoming **job-ready for backend developer roles**.
