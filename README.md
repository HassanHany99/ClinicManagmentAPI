# Clinic Management System API 🏥

A RESTful Web API for managing doctors, patients, clinics, appointments, and diagnoses — built with ASP.NET Core Web API using a clean, layered, and scalable architecture.

---

## ✅ What's Done

- ✅ Structured using layered architecture: **Controllers ➜ Services ➜ Repositories ➜ Unit of Work**
- ✅ Applied **Entity Framework Core** (Code First) with **Fluent API**
- ✅ Built full **CRUD operations** for:
  - 🧑‍⚕️ Doctor
  - 👤 Patient
  - 🏥 Clinics
  - 📅 Appointments
  - 📝 Diagnosis
- ✅ Used **AutoMapper** for clean and efficient DTO mapping
- ✅ Implemented full **async/await** pattern to avoid blocking calls
- ✅ Committed to **Clean Code**, **SOLID principles**, and separation of concerns
- 🛠️ Currently integrating **JWT Authentication** & **Authorization**

## 🧩 What's Next

- ⏳ Apply **Validation** to DTOs using Data Annotations or FluentValidation
- 🔐 Finalize **JWT Authentication** & **Role-based Authorization**
- 🛡️ Build **Global Exception Handling Middleware**
- 🧾 Add **Logging** and structured **Error Tracking**
- 🧪 Add **Unit Tests** for services

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **ASP.NET Core Web API** (.NET 8)
- **Entity Framework Core** + SQL Server
- **AutoMapper**
- **LINQ**
- **Repository Pattern + Unit of Work**
- **RESTful API Design**
- **JWT Authentication** *(in progress)*
- **C# 12**

---

## 🧠 Architecture

- `Controllers` → Handle API endpoints (request/response)
- `Services` → Business logic + cross-cutting concerns
- `Repositories` → Direct database communication
- `Unit of Work` → Manage transactions and consistency
- `DTOs` → Abstract and sanitize data across layers
- `AutoMapper` → Clean transformation between Entities ⇄ DTOs

---

## 🔐 Security

JWT authentication is being integrated to protect endpoints and support secure access for users (Admin/Doctor).

---

## 🚀 Project Status

The **core structure is complete**, covering major clinic operations (doctors, patients, appointments, diagnosis, and clinics).  
The project is being continuously **refined** and **expanded** to reflect real-world backend development practices and production readiness.

---

## 📌 Notes

This project is built from scratch to master backend development using .NET, and to demonstrate clean architecture, database relationships, async programming, and scalable patterns — with a goal of becoming **job-ready for backend development roles**.

Stay tuned for upcoming improvements! 🚀
